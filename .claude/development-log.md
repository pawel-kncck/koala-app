### Changes:

#### 02:30 - Create/update development log for Phase 2 session
**Commit**: `9dbd18e` - `chore(logs): initialize Phase 2 development log`
**Files Modified**: 
- `.claude/development-log.md` - Created comprehensive log for Phase 2 Baby Shark implementation

**Details**:
- Initialized development log with Phase 2 todo list
- Following mandatory logging requirements from CLAUDE.md
- Phase 2 focuses on backend functionality: Upload -> Context -> Chat
- Will implement API endpoints as specified in technical requirements

**Code Snippet**:
```markdown
Phase 2 Goals:
1. Data Studio Backend - File upload, listing, preview, deletion
2. Context Backend - Save/retrieve project context
3. Chat Backend - Basic LLM integration with context prepending
```

#### 02:35 - Set up backend API structure for Data Studio
**Commit**: `3e8d37a` - `feat(backend): set up FastAPI backend structure`
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for FastAPI backend
- `backend/main.py` - Main FastAPI application with all endpoints
- `backend/.env` - Environment configuration

**Details**:
- Chose FastAPI for backend as specified in technical requirements
- Implemented complete API structure with all required endpoints
- Added CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Used in-memory storage for MVP (to be replaced with PostgreSQL later)
- Included pandas for CSV/Excel file handling
- Added chardet for encoding detection to fix CSV parsing issues

**Code Snippet**:
```python
# File upload with encoding detection
if file_ext == '.csv':
    detected = chardet.detect(content)
    encoding = detected['encoding'] or 'utf-8'
```

---

#### 03:00 - Connect frontend to new backend endpoints (Part 1 - DataStudioTab)
**Commit**: `0d8f237` - `feat(frontend): connect DataStudioTab to backend API`
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/services/api.ts` - Created API client service
- `App.tsx` - Updated to load projects from backend
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Integrated with backend project management
- `components/MainContent.tsx` - Pass project data to tabs
- `components/DataStudioTab.tsx` - Full API integration

**Details**:
- Created comprehensive API client with all endpoint methods
- Updated App component to manage projects from backend
- Added loading states and error handling throughout
- Integrated file upload, preview, and delete functionality
- Fixed encoding detection moved to backend as specified

**Code Snippet**:
```typescript
// Dynamic preview data loading
const handlePreview = async (fileId: string) => {
  setPreviewLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = await api.files.preview(projectId, fileId);
    setPreviewData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to preview file:', error);
  }
};
```

#### 03:10 - Connect frontend to new backend endpoints (Part 2 - Context & Chat)
**Commit**: `fc1b076` - `feat(frontend): integrate Context and Chat tabs with backend`
**Files Modified**: 
- `components/ContextTab.tsx` - API integration for context management
- `components/ChatTab.tsx` - Connected to chat endpoint

**Details**:
- ContextTab now loads and saves context to backend
- Added loading and saving states with UI feedback
- ChatTab sends messages to backend API
- Added "Thinking..." indicator during AI processing
- Disabled input during message processing
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

**Code Snippet**:
```typescript
// Chat API integration
const response = await api.chat.sendMessage(projectId, userMessage.content);
const aiResponse: Message = {
  id: (Date.now() + 1).toString(),
  role: 'assistant',
  content: response.response,
  timestamp: new Date(response.timestamp),
};
```

### Phase 3: Growing Panda - Core Data Intelligence

### Todo List:
- [ ] Set up secure Docker-based code execution environment
- [ ] Create Python subprocess sandboxing with restricted permissions
- [ ] Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, timeout) for code execution
- [ ] Build restricted imports system (allow only pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- [ ] Create code execution API endpoint (/api/execute)
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API for LLM functionality
- [ ] Implement data schema inspection for uploaded files
- [ ] Build LLM-to-Pandas code generation logic
- [ ] Enhance chat endpoint with real LLM and code execution
- [ ] Add streaming responses for chat interface
- [ ] Implement result formatting (tables, numbers, insights)
- [ ] Create error handling for LLM and code execution failures
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for code execution audit trail
- [ ] Write tests for code execution security
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with Phase 3 completion status

### Changes:

#### [10:00] - Phase 3 Planning and Analysis
**Details**:
- Analyzed current Phase 2 implementation status
- Created comprehensive todo list for Phase 3 "Growing Panda"
- Identified critical security requirements for code execution
- Prioritized Docker-based sandboxing approach for safety

**Key Findings**:
- Phase 2 is complete with all basic CRUD operations
- Backend has mock chat endpoint ready for real LLM integration
- Pandas already installed and used for file preview
- Main gap: secure code execution and LLM integration

#### [10:05] - Set up secure Docker-based code execution environment
**Commit**: `b3cd67f` - `feat(backend): set up Docker-based secure code execution environment`
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/Dockerfile.sandbox` - Docker image for secure Python execution
- `backend/code_executor.py` - CodeExecutor class for managing Docker containers

**Details**:
- Created minimal Python Docker image with only allowed data science packages
- Implemented CodeExecutor class with comprehensive security measures
- Security features implemented:
  - No network access (--network none)
  - Memory and CPU limits (configurable)
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Non-root user execution
  - Dropped all Linux capabilities
  - No privilege escalation
- Code wrapping system that loads data files and captures results
- Validation to prevent dangerous imports and functions

**Code Snippet**:
```python
# Docker security flags
docker_cmd = [
    "docker", "run",
    "--rm",
    "--network", "none",
    "--memory", self.memory_limit,
    "--cpus", self.cpu_limit,
    "--read-only",
    "--cap-drop", "ALL",
    "--security-opt", "no-new-privileges",
    self.docker_image,
    "/sandbox/workspace/user_code.py"
]
```
