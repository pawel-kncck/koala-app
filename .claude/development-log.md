#### 02:35 - Set up backend API structure for Data Studio
**Commit**: `3e8d37a` - `feat(backend): set up FastAPI backend structure`
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for FastAPI backend
- `backend/main.py` - Main FastAPI application with all endpoints
- `backend/.env` - Environment configuration

**Details**:
- Chose FastAPI for backend as specified in technical requirements
- Implemented complete API structure with all required endpoints
- Added CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Used in-memory storage for MVP (to be replaced with PostgreSQL later)

- Added chardet for encoding detection to fix CSV parsing issues

**Code Snippet**:
```python
# File upload with encoding detection
if file_ext == '.csv':
    detected = chardet.detect(content)
    encoding = detected['encoding'] or 'utf-8'
```
