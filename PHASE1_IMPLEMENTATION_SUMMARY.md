## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns
- Component-based architecture with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with shadcn/ui components
- Mock data and interactions ready for backend integration
- Proper state management with React hooks
- Responsive design principles

### Key Files Modified
1. `components/Sidebar.tsx` - Enhanced with project management
2. `components/DataStudioTab.tsx` - Full file upload functionality
3. `components/ContextTab.tsx` - Context management with UX improvements
4. `components/ChatTab.tsx` - Context-aware chat interface
5. `App.tsx` - Updated default states
6. `index.html` - Theme consistency improvements
7. `styles/globals.css` - Added fade-in animation

## User Flow Implementation

The implementation follows the specified user flows from the PRD:

1. **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects via the sidebar dialog
2. **Data Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload CSV/Excel files
3. **Context Definition**: Save business context to inform AI responses
4. **Chat Interaction**: Context-aware conversations about data

## Next Steps (Phase 2 "Baby Shark")

The UI is now ready for backend integration:
1. Connect file upload to actual backend API
2. Implement context persistence in database
3. Wire up chat to LLM with context prepending
4. Add user authentication
5. Implement real project CRUD operations

## Testing Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
4. Test the following flows:
   - Create a new project
   - Upload a file (try july_sales.csv)
   - Add context about your data
   - Ask questions in the chat

The Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for the MVP, with all UI components functional and ready for backend integration.
