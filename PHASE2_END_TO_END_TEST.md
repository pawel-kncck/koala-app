  ],
  "total_rows": 2,
  "preview_rows": 100
}
```

### 4. Context Management ✅

```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Context updated successfully",
  "context": {
    "project_id": "8fb919f8-83f1-4c06-a7f5-7549b9843a5b",
    "content": "This is test data for Phase 2 validation",

  }
}
```

### 5. Chat Integration ✅

#### Send Chat Message
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/projects/{project_id}/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "{project_id}", "message": "What can you tell me about this data?"}'
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "I understand you're asking about: 'What can you tell me about this data?'. Based on the context you provided about This is test data for Phase 2 validation..., I can help you analyze your data. In the next phase, I'll be able to access your uploaded files and provide real insights.",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-02T02:44:24.178608",
  "used_context": true
}
```

## Test Summary

✅ **All core functionality tested and working:**
- Backend API is running and accessible
- Project creation and management works
- File upload with validation succeeds
- CSV parsing moved to backend with encoding detection
- File preview returns correct data structure
- Context storage and retrieval functional
- Chat endpoint accepts messages and returns context-aware responses
- All endpoints have proper error handling

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete API Implementation**: All endpoints specified in Phase 2 are implemented and functional
2. **File Processing**: CSV files are properly uploaded, stored, and parsed with pandas
3. **Context Integration**: Context is stored per project and used in chat responses
4. **Mock AI Responses**: Chat returns context-aware mock responses ready for LLM integration
5. **Error Handling**: All endpoints handle missing data and invalid requests gracefully

## Ready for Phase 3

The Phase 2 implementation is complete and provides a solid foundation for Phase 3 "Growing Panda" features:
- Secure Python code execution environment
- Real pandas data analysis
- LLM API integration for actual AI responses
- Data-aware chat functionality

## Notes

- In-memory storage is working as expected for MVP
- All API responses follow consistent format
- Frontend-backend integration is seamless with CORS properly configured
- File encoding detection prevents CSV parsing errors
