# Security Audit Report - Koala App Repository

**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Auditor**: Claude Code Security Check  
**Repository**: https://github.com/pawel-kncck/koala-app  
**Status**: 14 commits ahead of origin/main (unpushed)

## 1. What Was Checked

### Repository Analysis
- Git commit history for sensitive data patterns
- All configuration files (.env, .yaml, .json, .xml)
- Source code for hardcoded credentials
- Uploaded files and test data
- Git-tracked vs ignored files
- Python virtual environment and dependencies
- Build artifacts and compiled files

### Search Patterns Used
- API keys (OpenAI, AWS, Google, etc.)
- Passwords and secrets
- Authentication tokens
- Private keys and certificates
- Database credentials
- Environment variables

## 2. Security Assessment

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES

1. **`.env` File Committed to Git**
   - **Location**: `backend/.env`
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL
   - **Issue**: Environment file with API key placeholder is tracked in git
   - **Details**: Contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
   - **Risk**: If a real API key is added, it will be exposed in git history

2. **Virtual Environment in Git**
   - **Location**: `backend/venv/`
   - **Severity**: HIGH
   - **Issue**: Entire Python virtual environment appears to be tracked
   - **Size**: Contains thousands of library files
   - **Risk**: Bloats repository, may contain cached credentials

### ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE ISSUES

3. **Uploaded User Data**
   - **Location**: `backend/uploads/`
   - **Files**: 3 CSV files with UUIDs
   - **Issue**: User-uploaded data stored in repository
   - **Risk**: Potential data privacy concerns

4. **Python Cache Files**
   - **Location**: `backend/__pycache__/`
   - **Issue**: Compiled Python bytecode in repository
   - **Risk**: Unnecessary files, potential information leakage

### ðŸŸ¢ GOOD PRACTICES OBSERVED

5. **No Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Code uses environment variables properly
   - API keys loaded from `.env` file
   - Placeholder values used in committed `.env`

6. **Security-Focused Code**
   - Sandboxed code execution implementation
   - Resource limits and timeout controls
   - Input validation for user code

## 3. Suggested Improvements

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (Before Push)

1. **Remove `.env` from Git History**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached backend/.env
   git commit -m "chore: remove .env from tracking"
   ```

2. **Remove Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached backend/venv/
   git commit -m "chore: remove venv from tracking"
   ```

3. **Update `.gitignore`**
   Add these entries:
   ```
   # Python
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   *.so
   .Python
   venv/
   env/
   ENV/
   
   # Environment files
   .env
   .env.*
   !.env.example
   
   # Uploads
   backend/uploads/*
   !backend/uploads/.gitkeep
   
   # IDE
   .vscode/
   .idea/
   *.swp
   *.swo
   
   # OS
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db
   ```

4. **Clean Git History** (if needed)
   Since `.env` only contains placeholders, a simple removal is sufficient.
   If real secrets were committed, use:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch backend/.env" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

### ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

5. **Environment Management**
   - Keep `.env.example` with placeholders
   - Document required environment variables in README
   - Consider using a secrets management service for production

6. **Data Privacy**
   - Add `backend/uploads/` to `.gitignore`
   - Create `.gitkeep` file to preserve directory structure
   - Implement data retention policies

7. **Security Documentation**
   - Add security guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Document the sandboxing approach
   - Create incident response plan

8. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   Consider adding:
   - Secret scanning (e.g., detect-secrets)
   - Linting for security issues
   - File size limits

## Summary

The repository has **CRITICAL security issues** that must be resolved before pushing to GitHub:
- `.env` file is tracked (though only contains placeholders)
- Virtual environment with 1000s of files is tracked
- User upload data is included

**Risk Level**: HIGH - These issues could lead to:
- Accidental API key exposure if `.env` is edited
- Repository bloat from venv files
- Privacy concerns from uploaded data

**Recommendation**: DO NOT PUSH until the immediate actions are completed. The fixes are straightforward and will prevent future security incidents.

## Verification Checklist

Before pushing:
- [ ] Remove `.env` from git tracking
- [ ] Remove `venv/` from git tracking
- [ ] Remove `__pycache__/` from git tracking
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` with proper patterns
- [ ] Verify no secrets in commit messages
- [ ] Consider squashing commits if needed
- [ ] Run `git status` to confirm clean state
