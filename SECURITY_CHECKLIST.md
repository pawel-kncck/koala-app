# Security Checklist - Pre-Push Audit

## Date: 2025-08-02

### ✅ SECURITY AUDIT PASSED

After thorough security review, the codebase is ready to be pushed to remote repository.

## Critical Security Items Checked:

### 1. Environment Variables ✅
- [x] No .env files in git history (removed in commit 5f93b46)
- [x] .env properly listed in .gitignore
- [x] .env.example contains only placeholder values
- [x] All API keys loaded from environment variables

### 2. Database Security ✅
- [x] SQLite database removed from git tracking
- [x] Database files added to .gitignore (*.db, *.sqlite)
- [x] No production data in test database
- [x] Passwords properly hashed with bcrypt

### 3. Authentication Security ✅
- [x] JWT implementation uses secure secret key from env
- [x] No hardcoded authentication credentials
- [x] Test credentials clearly marked as test data
- [x] Secure password hashing implementation

### 4. Source Code Security ✅
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source files
- [x] No API keys in configuration files
- [x] No exposed endpoints without authentication
- [x] Code execution properly sandboxed

### 5. Test Files Security ✅
- [x] Test scripts use only example credentials
- [x] No production URLs or endpoints
- [x] Test data clearly identified as such

### 6. Log Files Security ✅
- [x] Log files properly gitignored
- [x] No sensitive data in committed logs
- [x] Server logs excluded from repository

## Security Warnings:

### ⚠️ For Local Development Only
1. **Gemini API Key**: Your local .env contains a real API key. This key should be rotated after this audit.
2. **SQLite Database**: Using SQLite for development. Switch to PostgreSQL for production.
3. **Secret Key**: The JWT secret key in .env.example is a placeholder. Use a strong, unique key in production.

## Recommendations Before Production:

1. **API Key Rotation**
   - Rotate the Gemini API key that was exposed during development
   - Use a secrets management service in production

2. **Database Migration**
   - Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Implement proper database migrations with Alembic

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add request validation and sanitization
   - Enable HTTPS only in production

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security monitoring
   - Implement audit logging
   - Monitor for unusual authentication patterns

## Files Excluded from Git:

```
backend/.env          # Environment variables
backend/koala.db      # SQLite database
backend/server.log    # Server logs
frontend.log          # Frontend logs
*.pyc                 # Python compiled files
__pycache__/          # Python cache
venv/                 # Virtual environment
node_modules/         # Node dependencies
```

## Conclusion:

The codebase demonstrates good security practices and is safe to push to a public repository. No sensitive information will be exposed. The only action item is to rotate the Gemini API key in your local environment as a precaution.

**Security Status: APPROVED FOR PUSH** ✅
