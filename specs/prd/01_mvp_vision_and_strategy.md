### **1. Problem Statement**

Modern businesses are data-rich but often insight-poor. While powerful tools like generic Large Language Models (LLMs) and data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas) exist, a critical gap prevents them from being truly effective for day-to-day analysis.

- **Generic LLMs lack context.** They can answer general questions but cannot provide meaningful insights about a specific dataset because they don't understand the business logic, the metrics, or the project goals behind the data.
- **Complex data tools require expertise.** Direct data analysis requires specialized coding skills, creating a bottleneck and slowing down the pace of business decision-making.

This results in a slow, inefficient process where data-savvy professionals must either over-simplify their queries for generic AIs or rely on overburdened technical teams for deeper analysis.

### **2. Target Audience**

Our primary target for this MVP is the **"Citizen Data Analyst."**

This persona represents a data-savvy professional who is deeply familiar with their business domain but is not a dedicated data scientist or programmer.

- **Roles:** Marketing Analysts, Business Analysts, Product Managers, Operations Managers, Founders.
- **Characteristics:**
  - They are comfortable working with data in tools like Excel or Google Sheets.
  - They understand their business KPIs and what questions they need to answer.
  - They find the process of writing and debugging scripts in Python or SQL to be a significant barrier to getting quick insights.
  - They have likely tried using tools like ChatGPT for data analysis but have been frustrated by the lack of specific, actionable results.

### **3. Value Proposition**

We are building an **AI-powered data co-pilot that understands your business context.**

Our application bridges the gap between your data and meaningful insights by creating a project-based environment where you can:

1.  **Upload your data** securely.
2.  **Teach the AI** the specific context of your project, metrics, and goals.
3.  **Analyze your data** through a simple, conversational chat interface.

Our unique value is delivering **faster, more relevant, and more accessible data analysis**, making it as easy as talking to an expert colleague who already knows your business inside and out.

### **4. MVP Success Metrics**

The goal of this MVP is to validate our core hypothesis: _If we provide an AI with business context, users will achieve more valuable data insights more quickly._

We will measure success by tracking the following key metrics:

- **Activation & Engagement:**
  - **Context Adoption Rate:** What percentage of new projects have a user-defined context of more than 100 characters? (Target: > 60%)
  - **Analysis Query Rate:** What percentage of active users ask at least one data-related question in the chat per week? (Target: > 40%)
- **Value Perception:**
  - **User Feedback (Qualitative):** Through user interviews, are testers reporting "aha!" moments or insights they wouldn't have easily reached otherwise?
  - **Feature Stickiness:** Are users returning to the same project to ask follow-up questions, indicating an ongoing analytical workflow?
